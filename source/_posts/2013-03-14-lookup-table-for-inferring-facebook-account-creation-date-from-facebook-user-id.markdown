In my [previous post](http://metadatascience.com/2013/03/11/inferring-facebook-account-creation-date-from-facebook-user-id/), I explained how we can estimate the account creation date of Facebook accounts that have a 15 digit UID without having to call the Facebook API and just based on the userâ€™s Facebook UID. 

Table below shows the correlation between Facebook UID and Facebook Account Creation Date for the sample set that I analysed.
The table is represented in [CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format as follows:

*Facebook UID, Account Creation Date(timestamp), Account Creation Date(date)*.

**Note #1:** To respect the users privacy I hided the last 5 digits of UIDs. You may replace 'x' by '0' and it should not cause any problem.

**Note #2:** For a more accurate result, this table should get updated.
